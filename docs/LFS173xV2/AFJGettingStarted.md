# Lab: Getting Started with Aries Framework JavaScript

## Overview

In this lab, we'll do many of the same things that we've done with Aries Cloud
Agent Python using Aries Framework JavaScript (AFJ), showing the similarities, and the
differences between the two Aries implementations. And yes, gnce again, we'll spend some
time with Alice and Faber.

## How to Run

This lab can be only be run locally. No Docker needed -- just your command line.

## Instructions

All of the instructions for running the demo can be found in [these instructions](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript/tree/main/demo) to run the demo. There are
some pre-requisites that must be installed, so make sure that you click into those instructions as well.

Hopefully that was straight-forward and easy.

The Aries Framework JavaScript project has a lot more documentation available. Check out the website [aries.js.org](https://aries.js.org/) to learn a lot more about Aries Framework JavaScript, including the basic concepts, tutorials and
other information on related components like [Aries Framework JavaScript Extensions](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript-ext) and the [Aries Bifold Mobile Wallet](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-mobile-agent-react-native).

## Takeaways

In completing this lab, you can see that each of the Aries Frameworks do more or less the same things. While the precise technical architecture might be a little different, the conceptual components of an agent being a controller and a framework, and agents interacting with one another using the same protocols shows the common core.
