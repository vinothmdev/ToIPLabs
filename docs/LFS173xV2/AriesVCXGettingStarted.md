# Getting Started with Aries VCX

## Overview

In this lab, we don't have much for you to do--at least not right now.
Unfortunately, there is not yet an Aries VCX "getting started" tutorial for
newcomers to the project. The Aries VCX team is planning to add one Real Soon
Now, and we'll update this lab as soon as there is such a tutorial available.

Monitor this document or [GitHub issue
#108](https://github.com/cloudcompass/ToIPLabs/issues/108) to find out when the
tutorial is available.

If you want to be notified via GitHub when the lab has been updated, add a
comment to [issue 108](https://github.com/cloudcompass/ToIPLabs/issues/108) and
you'll get an email whenever the issue is updated.

## How to Run

This lab is a browser only lab.

## Instructions

Since there is no getting started tutorial, we'll just direct you to the [Aries
VCX repository](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-vcx). If you know Rust and
study the repo a bit, perhaps you can get something running on your own!

## Takeaways

Not much in the way of instruction for this lab -- yet. If you are interested --
watch for an update. As you might guess though, Aries VCX is pretty similar to
Aries Framework JavaScript and Aries Cloud Agent Python. The conceptual
architecture is the same, and the agents, regardless of the Framework on which
they are based, all interact using the same protocols.

Want to check on the interoperability between Aries VCX and Aries Cloud Agent
Python? Remember to check out

That's it for this lab! Please return to the course.
